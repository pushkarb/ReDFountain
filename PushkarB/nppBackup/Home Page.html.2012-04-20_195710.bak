		<h3>An Introduction</h3>
		I joined University of Florida in Fall 2010. I am pursuing my Master of Science degree in the field of Computer Science.
		<br/><br/>
		I'am passionate programmer and my areas of interest include Databases, Data Mining. I am currently researching on Spatial Databases and working towards the implementation of spatial databases C++ libraries under 
		Professor <a href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~mschneid/">Dr.Markus Schneider</a>.<br/><br/>
		Details about the courses taken and my GPA can be found <a href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/~pushkar/courses.html">here</a>.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Through my undergraduate studies, I have been interested in the field of databases. My work at Oracle Corporation for over 2 years 
		in the Healthcare Global business unit, gave me an insight into data warehousing and data mining and helped me learn about their importance in the real world. I then decided
		to pursue my graduate study in the same field to harness my interest and learn about the latest developments in this enormous and rapidly growing field.
